I wrote this for notekeeping on a previous job. It uses Perl Tk so you will need to install "Tk" before it will work. It is missing key features like input validation, error handling, and auto-save but it worked for me. I used auto HotKey previously and this just made things a little easier. If you are wondering why I called is ashes, its because those are the letter from my name, minus one "A".
