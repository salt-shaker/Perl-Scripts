# XML Notes
This was part of my push toward web development. This was to be the proto-type for the XML engine behind Ashes Notekeeper. I wanted to make it so I could import and export XML files to a web interface. Javascript and JSON are awesome and run in a web browser which everyone already has. Perl is the king of its domain, unfortunately that domain is 404 not found.
