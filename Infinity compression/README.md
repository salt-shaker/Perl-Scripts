# Infinity Compression

When I was younger I convinced myself that it was possible to compress a binary file to any size. After a while that belief changed to me thinking a file could be compressed to limited set size file from any size larger file. Then I just forgot about it because the subtle art of file compression uses some serious math skills, math is fun, but it's not that fun.

I still think it is possible but it will take some fancy foot work to make it possible.
